# Sliding_Racetrack
A script that converts zig-zag flight plans generated in Mission Planner to the Sliding Racetrack flight pattern.

This flight pattern is used by the Paparazzi autopilot, but is not available for the Mission Planner software. This script addresses this issue.

The script can be integrated into a context menu using a tool such as the freeware Default Programs Editor
